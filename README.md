# PatientSafetyApp Project Documentation

## Overview
PatientSafetyApp is a mobile application focused on medication tracking, medical history management, and patient education. The app helps users track medications, record symptoms, log diagnoses, and maintain medical history while checking for potential medication safety issues through the FDA's drug database.

## Key Features
- Medication tracking with FDA safety checks
- Symptom recording
- Diagnosis logging
- Medical history management
- Educational content
- Local secure data storage
- Modern UI with intuitive navigation

## Project Setup Process

### Initial Setup
1. Created a new Expo project with TypeScript template
2. Established project structure with directories for:
   - components
   - contexts
   - navigation
   - screens
   - services
   - types
   - utils

### Dependencies Installed
- React Navigation (stack, bottom tabs)
- Expo Secure Store for secure data storage
- React Native Paper for UI components
- Axios for API requests
- Environment variable configuration

### Key Components Created
1. **PatientContext:** Context provider for state management across the app
2. **Navigation:** Stack and tab navigation implementation
3. **Screens:**
   - HomeScreen
   - ProfileScreen
   - MedicationsScreen
   - MedicationDetailScreen
   - AddMedicationScreen
   - SymptomsScreen
   - DiagnosesScreen
   - MedicalHistoryScreen
   - AddMedicalHistoryScreen
   - EducationScreen
   - AnalysisScreen

4. **Services:**
   - StorageService: Secure storage of sensitive and non-sensitive data
   - ApiService: Integration with FDA API

### Configuration Files
- Created `.env` file for storing API keys
- Configured babel.config.js to support environment variables
- Set up tsconfig.json for TypeScript support

### Integration and Testing
- Fixed directory structure to ensure proper imports
- Copied necessary files (App.tsx, src directory, .env, babel.config.js) to the correct locations
- Tested the application with Expo

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Ensure `.env` file contains the FDA API key:
   ```
   API_KEY=your_fda_api_key_here
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npx expo start
   ```

4. Scan the QR code with:
   - Expo Go app (Android)
   - Camera app (iOS)

## Privacy and Security
The application prioritizes user privacy by storing all sensitive data locally on the device using secure storage mechanisms. No personal health information is transmitted to external servers except when checking medication safety through the FDA API.
